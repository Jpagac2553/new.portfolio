<!--My about me section containing ol&ul -->
          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p> I have been a skilled trades worker for the past 5 years after graduating highschool. Though the trades have been good to me, I have found much interest in the tech field, because it is very much a "skilled trade" of its own, and the whole process behind development is quite intriguing to me. I am happy to learn, commit, and network with others on this journey. Group projects and tasks with others is very much enjoyable for me currently, and I cannot wait to do this in the development field as well!</p>

          <p><b>Outside of work and development I enjoy:</b></p>
          <ol>
              <li><b>Guitar</b></li>
              <li><b>Biking</b></li>
              <li><b>Hiking</b></li>
          </ol>

          <p><b>I also enjoy:</b></p>
